Here's a really bad "game" example I wrote just to test out the very basics of the engine.

Object:
You control a yellow smiley face that continuously falls and wraps around the screen horizontally and vertically by tapping either the left or right
arrow keys to shift its position. The object of the game is to not hit any of the angry red faces moving horizontally or else you die
and the game ends.

I probably spent more time making the images in MS Paint than I did coding this game. The point is just to show where the appropriate overrides
and such belong in implenting the abstract classes to make things begin to happen. If you examine the code it doesn't take much.


NOTE: Make sure all the appropriate engine files (all the .h and dll files from the folder above this one) are in the same directory as the 
GameTest files so that it finds them and works and stuff.

Have Fun!
